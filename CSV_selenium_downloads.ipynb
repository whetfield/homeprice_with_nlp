    "Use selenium to go through a list of Redfin urls.  The URLs are zoomed out maps of home sale transactions.  Redfin offers data downloads of CSVs of the transactions which appear on the maps, but the number of transaction which can appear in each CSV is 350.  So on a \"zoomed out\" map of a region, there are thousands of transactions in the mapped area, but downloading will only yield a small portion of them.  This notebook goes through a list of \"zoomed out\" map URLs and progressively tries all the different options to zoom in on the map and downloading CSVs of 350 transactions, thus capturing a large portion of the transactions "
