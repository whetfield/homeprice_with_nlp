# Home Price Prediction with NLP

Final Project (Project Kojak) during the Metis Data Science Immersive. I wanted to build a home price prediction model with two new components from what was available online: 1) Create a new data set from recent transactions rather than what is available online from an old Kaggle competition, for instance 2) See if text features from a home price listing could add any predictive power to a model
